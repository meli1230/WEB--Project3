# NodeJS Web App - Women Techpower

## Overview  
This project is a **Node.js-based web application** for managing **events, job postings, mentorship programs, and user authentication**. It features **secure login and database integration** to ensure scalable and efficient data handling.  

## Features  

### **User Authentication & Security**  
- **User login & registration system**
- **JWT-based authentication** for secure API access
- **Password hashing & session management**

### **Event & Job Management**  
- **Create, update, delete, and view events and job listings**  
- **Database-driven CRUD operations**  

### **Mentorship Program**  
- **Manage mentorship opportunities** with structured data  
- **API routes for mentorship details and interactions**  

### **RESTful API & Database Integration**  
- **Express.js REST API** for event, job, and user management  
- **Secure data validation and error handling**  

## **Project Structure**  
- app.js → Main application file
- auth.js → Handles user authentication and JWT tokens
- db.js → Database connection using MySQL
- routes/ → API endpoints for different modules
- models/ → Mongoose schemas for structured data
- public/ → Static assets (CSS, JavaScript, images)

## Console commands used

### `node app.js`
- runs the application

### `npm install express mysql2 ejs bcrypt passport passport-local express-session`
- `npm install`: installs Node.js modules using npm (node package manager)
- `express` 
  - a web application framework for Node.js
  - simplified handling HTTP requests, routing and rendering views
  - *ex: handles routes like `/register`, `/login`, `/dashboard`*
- `mysql2`
  - a library that allows the app to interact with the MySQL database
  - stores user data
  - contains promise support, which is used in this app (`pending`, `fulfilled`, `rejected`)
- `ejs` (Embedded JavaScript)
  - template engine for NodeJS
  - useful for rendering data from the server to the client
  - *ex: renders pages like login.ejs with dynamic data*
- `bcrypt`
  - library to hash passwords securely 
- `passport`
  - handles authentication in Node.js applications
  - simplifies the login/logout process, by supporting various strategies
  - *ex: authenticates users during login*
- `passport-local`
  - strategy used by passport for authenticating users with a username and password
  - verifies user credentials by comparing input with stored data
  - *ex: checks if the entered password matches the hashed password during login*
- `express-session`
  - used to persist user sessions across multiple requests
  - maintains the user session after login
